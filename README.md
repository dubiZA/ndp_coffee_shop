# Uda-Spice Latte Cafe Project

## IAM Final Project

Udacity has decided to open a new digitally enabled cafe for students to order drinks, socialize, and study hard. But they need help setting up their menu experience.

You have been called on to demonstrate your newly learned skills to create a full stack drink menu application. The application must:

1) Display graphics representing the ratios of ingredients in each drink.
2) Allow public users to view drink names and graphics.
3) Allow the shop baristas to see the recipe information.
4) Allow the shop managers to create new drinks and edit existing drinks.

## Style Guide

The da-Spice Latte Cafe Project API backend is written with PEP 8 as the style guide. Google's yapf formatter was used to format the code. For consistency, code contributions should be formatted using yapf before being merged. It can be installed with `pip install yapf` or view the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/google/yapf). Use the ```bash --stype pep8``` switch.
